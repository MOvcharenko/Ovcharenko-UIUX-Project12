What I've learnt:

1: a clear understanding of how hoisting and function types affect code execution order

2: how closures work and how arrow functions differ in behavior, especially regarding variable context

3: how variable declarations and function context affect my code and how to avoid common pitfalls, 'this' usage in let and var
